# Administrator authentication
** Simple, hard coded hash for single (or few) administrators
** ~Master_Control panel to add administrators (and perform other administrative tasks)
** Open user registration (would need email facility)

# Search function
** Simple grep style to start with
** Automated indexed word building

# SEO concerns
** Very poor Google juice as initially constructed
** Need to generate HTML instead of "wiki body" files

# Advanced editor features
** Though overarching philosophy is to keep this is simple and minimalistic as possible.
** Still, some features to add:
*** File/image uploads
*** Preview formatted HTML as wiki text is entered
