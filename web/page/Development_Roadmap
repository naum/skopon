# Administrator authentication
** Simple, hard coded hash for single (or few) administrators
** ~Master_Control panel to add administrators (and perform other administrative tasks)
** Open user registration (would need email facility)

# Search function
** Simple grep style to start with
** Automated indexed word building

# SEO concerns
** Very poor Google juice as initially constructed
** Need to generate HTML instead of "wiki body" files
